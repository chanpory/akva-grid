Akva Grid is (will be) a fluid grid overlay helper.
There is an early demo version that I'm trying out on www.piira.se/akva-grid. Still lot's of fun work ahead!

As of now akva-grid is working nicely with the Chrome browser. This is mostly because I'm using the flexible box-model for the grid. Later on I might try CSS table-cell layout as a fallback for less capable browsers. 

Other planned features are:
* Set width (width, min-width, max-width)
* Optional px or % units for the gutters
* Customize the grid in steps with media queries. 
* Save favorite grid

etc.
