Akva Grid is (will be) a fluid grid overlay helper. Maybe in form of a marklet, or good ol' plugin to add to your project. 
You can find an early demo version that I'm trying out on www.piira.se/akva-grid.



TODO:

Prio:
* offset line-height
* gutters units (px / %)
* custom width, max-width, min-width
* build grid controller form (and make it hidable)
* Media query break points
* Save favorite grid

More:
js/css - able to choose bg color on cols or the standard outlines. rgba(0, 50, 100, .2)

Maybe:
js - set color of grid lines
